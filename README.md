#Artemis.js

Artemis.js is a JavaScript port of the [Artemis](http://gamadu.com/artemis) Entity System framework.

> The framework is based on the concept that entities in a game world exist as
> pure identifiers, their components contain only data, and systems process
> entities based on their aspects. This promotes separation of concern and
> simplifies game design tremendously.
